Cub3D Parsing (order is important): TO BE FINISHED BEFORE MONDAY 8 AM


Not sure
Not doing but maybe should


Every Malloc : 
* 



1. Get the entire file
   1. argc = 2
   2. get path and fd
   3. remove empty lines until 7 non empty lines have passed
   4. remove blank in 6 first lines
2. Paths
   1. get textures paths without prefixes (if prefixe missing || prefix unrecognized -> exit ? error on map chars or missing path anyway but easy (at least for unrecognized) since prefixes checked anyway for affiliation)
   2. get rgb (char then int) (do check on int ? char)
   3. check every path was found
   4. check .xpm extensions on texture (and ./)
   5. check rgb count = 3 and 0 <= rgb <= 255 and 2 ‘.’ format
   6. convert rgb to hexadecimal
3. Set tmp for map checks
   1. remove 6 first lines
   2. check map contains ‘ ‘ || ‘0’ || ‘1’ || ‘\n’ && direction/p- ONLY and set p-
   3. that p- isn’t on border or stuck in 1x1
   4. perform *floodfill
   5. get map length and width
4. Set map
   1. Copy tmp into map by getting every line filled with 2 till width
   2. Free tmp




*For floodfill: check every 0 isn’t on border, next to a ‘ ‘ or next to a ‘\n’
